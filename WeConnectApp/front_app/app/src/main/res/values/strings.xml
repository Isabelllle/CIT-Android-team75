        \n
         Volunteering Victoria Incorporated (we, our, us) recognises the importance of protecting the
    privacy and the rights of individuals in relation to their personal information. This document
    is our privacy policy and it tells you how we collect, use, hold and disclose your personal
    information.\n
        \n
    We respect your rights to privacy under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (Act) and, where we are
    required to do so, we comply with all of the Act’s requirements in respect of the collection,
    management and disclosure of your personal information.\n
        \n
        What is your personal information?\n
        \n
    When used in this Privacy Policy, the term ‘personal information’ has the meaning given to it
    in the Act. In general terms, it is any information that can be used to personally identify you.
    This may include your name, address, telephone number, email address and profession or
    occupation. If the information we collect personally identifies you, or you are reasonably
    identifiable from it, the information will be considered personal information.\n
        \n
What personal information do we collect and hold?\n
        \n
We may collect the following types of personal information:\n

indirectly through our website or online presence, through our representatives
or otherwise; and\n
 information you provide to us through our office, surveys or visits by our
representatives from time to time.\n
        \n
We may also collect some information that is not personal information because it does not
identify you or anyone else. For example, we may collect anonymous answers to surveys or
aggregated information about how users use our website.\n
        For what purposes do we collect, hold, use and disclose your personal
information?

• we have an obligation to use or disclose the information or there is another
permitted purpose; or
• you consent to the use or disclosure.
Your personal information will not be shared, sold, rented or disclosed other than as
